# Crystal Projector

This is a library for manipulating data structures in the video game [Crystal Project](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1637730/Crystal_Project/). This currently can read:

- World files (support for reading entities is WIP)
- Some database files (abilities to statuses, plus voxels)
- Texture packs

This will hopefully soon be able to modify and write out the above, as well as read additional things, like save files and mods.

This is a heavy work in progress; there is no interface, the Python packaging is not yet set up, and debug code is all over the place. Still, if you're interested, look at [COMPILING.md] for more information, and if you want to operate with Crystal Project using other languages, look in [schema] for reusable schema definitions.
